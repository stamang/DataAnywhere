DataAnywhere
============

Data is available in bits publicly, but aggregated by companies that want to charge for it.  Other data may be free in aggregate form, but not available for live query/access. This project aims to solve both problems, one data set at a time. 

Concept
============
Data is available in bits publicly, but aggregated by companies that want to charge for it. Other data may be free in aggregate form, but not available for live query/access. This project aims to solve both problems, one data set at a time and establish a nimble web-based architecture to support a participatory data commons for the Public.

Using open source tools, the Data Anywhere aims to train and support community organizers, technologists, and researchers to participate in the continued development of a distributed open data sharing architecture that will provide a portal to collection of open data sets to the public.  These data sets can be queried individually, or leveraged with other knowledge sources to inform organizational decision-making, or for data-driven activism more broadly.  In addition to the open sharing data component, for those organizations that adopt it's use, it provides a flexible model and can be easily extended to accommodate private and public views to a database.

Benefits
============
Although just taking off, the Data Anywhere project has the potential to help many organizations. It integrates a persistent data model; if one machine is shut down, no permanent loss is incurred to the data set, since it replicated itself to several other machines.  

The data servers can be used to aggregate any type of data, and make it accessible to the public at large, through a simple ReSTful web interface. The longer term vision of this project is to use the data for mining and visualizing data sets, chronologically at first, but could be compared along any index.  

We're actively looking for more resources to accommodate interested parties, and to develop documentation and other training materials.   The teaching resources will include instructions on how to set up and secure a server, and basic principles of database engineering, and data science.
